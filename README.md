## 🏗️ Architecture

**Profile System** - Context-aware configurations that adapt behavior per environment (work/home/laptop)

**Secrets Management** - Git-ignored file for storing personal data (emails, URLs, credentials)

**Dashboards** - WebView2-powered UIs combining modern web technologies with AHK backend

**Apps Integrated** - Background services that run continuously and integrate via hotkeys

**Apps Standalone** - Independent utilities that can run separately (Window Manager, Command Storer, etc.) 


## 💭 Philosophy

This project embraces **code-first configuration** - sometimes editing code is faster (and more fun) than clicking through UIs. All components are designed to be modular and readable with OOP and SOLID principles in mind.

**Open & Collaborative** - Free to use, modify, and share.
