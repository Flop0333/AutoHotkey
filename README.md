Hey everyone! 👋

I'm excited to show my AutoHotkey v2 workflow system that I've been building! It's a modular collection of productivity tools that's transformed how I work.

## ✨ Features

### Core Tools

### Productivity Apps
- 📸 **Screen Snipper** - Screenshot/snipper tool with OCR support
- 🐭 **Mouse Gestures** -

- 🧑‍💻 **Command Storer** - Quick access to frequently used commands
- 🤓 **Emoji Sender** - Quick emoji picker with keyboard shortcuts
- ⌨️ **Capslock Modifier** - Capslock as powerful modifier key
- ♾️ **And much more!**


## 🏗️ Architecture

**Profile System** - Context-aware configurations that adapt behavior per environment (work/home/laptop)

**Secrets Management** - Git-ignored file for storing personal data (emails, URLs, credentials)

**Dashboards** - WebView2-powered UIs combining modern web technologies with AHK backend

**Apps Integrated** - Background services that run continuously and integrate via hotkeys

**Apps Standalone** - Independent utilities that can run separately (Window Manager, Command Storer, etc.) 


## 💭 Philosophy
Every component is modular, following OOP/SOLID principles and build with care for maximum flexibility and maintainability.

This project embraces **code-first configuration** - sometimes editing code is faster (and more fun) than clicking through UIs.


**Final**
I can't wait to hear your thoughts, feedback & bug reports.
Let me know what you think! 💭
